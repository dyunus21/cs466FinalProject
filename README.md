# Needleman-Wunsch: Global, Local and Fitting Alignment
This project extends the Needleman-Wunsch aligner by Mostafa Abdelraouf ([github](https://github.com/drdrsh/Needleman-Wunsch/tree/master), [website](http://experiments.mostafa.io/public/needleman-wunsch/)) to encompass fitting alignments and local alignments, enhancing its versatility for various biological sequence alignment scenarios. Our implementation is guided by theoretical foundations from course materials, slides, and programming assignments. Written in JavaScript with a user-centric design, the project provides users with a comprehensive tool for performing global, fitting, and local alignments.
